# Dialogflow Chatbot Generator (from yes-no decision tree)
This script generates an agent zip file that can be directly
imported into DialogFlow. 

## CSV File
The CSV file represents a decision tree. The flow of the conversation will
be determined through this decision tree.
The first line of the CSV file must contain the following header:

    Questions,Yes,No,Unique Identifier
    
**Questions**: The question to prompt the user with  
**Yes**: What the chatbot should reply with if the user replied with *yes*  
**No**: What the chatbot should reply with if the user replied with *no*  
**Unique Identifier**: A unique short (~3-8 words) text that uniquely identifies each question  

The following is an example of a decision tree and its corresponding CSV file

    Questions,Yes,No,Unique Identifier
    Do you like Asian food?,1 line down,Eat some pasta,asian food
    Do you like Chinese food?,Eat some dumplings,Eat some ramen,chinese food
    
## How to run script
1. Update the *questions-formatted.csv* file provided in the root directory
2. In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of the chatbot generator
3. Run `python3 chatbot-generator.py` to generate the agent files. This will generate a *target* folder
containing a *chatbot.zip* file and a *chatbot* folder. The zip file will be 
imported directly into DialogFlow, and the *chatbot* folder contains the files and
directories in the zip file (this folder can be ignored)


## How to import into DialogFlow
1. Log in to your DialogFlow account then create a new agent
2. Navigate to agent settings then navigate to *Export and Import*
3. Click *Restore from zip* then select the *chatbot.zip* file that
was generated by the script. Type *RESTORE* then click the *Restore*
button.  
**Warning: If you are using a preexisting agent, this step will 
replace the current agent version with a new one. All the 
intents and entities in the older version will be deleted.**
